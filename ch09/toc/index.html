		<h1>7 reasons why trainers like our books</h1>		
		<aside></aside>	
		<article>
			<h2>Modular book organization</h2>
			<p>In the first section or two of all our books, we present the core content
			for the book, which includes a complete subset of usable skills. After the core
			content, each section of the book is designed as an independent module. This
			means that these sections don't have to be taught in sequence. As a result, you
			can customize your courses by assigning just those sections that you want to
			teach.</p>
			<p>Whenever possible, each of the chapters is also designed as an independent
			module. When this is true, you can assign just those chapters that are right
			for your courses. This approach also makes the chapters better for on-the-job
			reference later on.</p>
	
			<h2>Top-down chapter design</h2>
			<p>Unlike many competing books and products, most chapters in our books have a
			unique top-down design that moves from the simple to complex. This makes it
			easier for trainees to learn. It also means that you can present the topics at
			the start of a chapter to make sure everyone understands the essential details,
			without presenting all of the topics in a chapter. Then, your trainees can
			learn the other topics on their own or as they're needed on the job.</p>
	
			<h2>Paired-pages format</h2>
			<p>If you page through one of our books, you'll see that all of the information
			is presented in &quot;paired pages.&quot; In each pair, the right page is a
			figure that contains the syntax, guidelines, and examples, and the left page is
			text that contains the perspective and extra explanation.</p>
			<p>One benefit of this format is that it lets trainees learn at their own pace.
			If, for example, you're a novice, you'll probably want to read the text on the
			left as you refer to the figure on the right. But if you have experience, you
			may be able to get all the information you need from the figure. Either way,
			our customers tell us that they love this presentation method because it helps
			them learn faster and better.</p>
	
			<h2>Performance on the job</h2>
			<p>On-the-job performance is the measure of a successful course. And our
			paired-pages format makes it easy for your trainees to access all the
			information you've covered long after the course is over. </p>
			<p>Instead of having to dig through the text or handouts, they can use the
			expanded table of contents or the index to find the topic they're looking for.
			Then, the figure on the righthand page will give them the details they need to
			apply what they learned in your course.</p>
			<p>This type of quick reference is absolutely essential when you're working
			with the hundreds of classes, methods, and properties of an OO language like
			Java, Visual Basic, or C#...and yet no other books offer this unique format.</p>

			<h2>More practice in less time</h2>
			<p>The exercises for our books give trainees a chance to get valuable, hands-on
			experience without wasting any time. That's because we provide the starting
			code, either from our web site or the Instructor's CD, so that trainees don't
			have to enter routine code that they already know.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, these exercises guide the trainees through the application of
			what they've just learned. Sometimes, they challenge the trainees to apply what
			they've learned in new ways. And you can assign the exercises so your trainees
			do them in class or on their own.</p>
			<p>Incidentally, unlike other books, <i>our exercises never present new skills
			or information</i>. As we see it, this is the only sensible approach to text
			and exercise design. Curiously, though, the exercises in some books do present
			new skills. Unfortunately, this means that (1) trainees who don't do the
			exercises don't learn the new skills, and (2) there's no easy way for trainees
			to find the information they need if they're having trouble since the skills
			haven't been covered yet.</p>

			<h2>Complete, real-world applications</h2>
			<p>From the first book we published in 1974 to the present, all of our books
			teach by presenting complete, real-world applications that include design,
			code, and all related components. These applications help your trainees get
			started quickly and also help them reach new skill levels. As we see it,
			studying applications like these is the best way to learn how all of the parts
			of an application work together, so this is an essential part of the learning
			process.</p>

			<h2>Complete instructor's materials</h2>
			<p>If you review the instructor's materials that come with the Instructor's CD
			for one of our books, you'll see that our CDs provide everything else you need
			for an effective course...except the busywork. That's why you should be able to
			plan and implement a course that's based on one of our books in record time.
			Once that's done, our books and instructional materials will help ensure the
			success of your course.</p>
